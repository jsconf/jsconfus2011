        <p>JSConf US 2011 will be held in the epic <a href="http://www.portlandartmuseum.org/">Portland Art Museum</a> on May 2nd and May 3rd. Yes - we are dragging the craziest conference ever westward AND bring it to culture, art, sophistication. What better place to house a conference themed around the artistic 8-bit excellence of a <a href="http://www.virtualapple.org/oregontraildisk.html">1985 Apple II</a> game? From rebels to pirates to wagoneers - JSConf never stops and this year we have more than a couple rivers to ford that will make your day.

        <p>"JSConf is awesome". That seems to be the going definition of this intimate conference dedicated to the JS programming language. One thing has been made clear, JSConf is one of the best tech conferences out there and rightly so, because JavaScript or JS is one of the best languages out there. The core focus of this conference is to present the wonders of JavaScript that are often overlooked. The content of the conference caters to all types of JavaScript developers from client interface to server development to testing. <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/communityjs_by_chris_williams_1.html">We are pirates. We are JSConf!</a></p>

        <a href="http://promotejs.com">About PromoteJS</a></p>
        <p>JSConf focuses on two things, presenting mind-altering JavaScript technology during the daytime and providing exceptional "networking" parties during the evenings. JavaScript is exploding on the scene despite years of being behind the curtain as the workhorse of the web. JSConf is right there to expose and help push the state of the art with JavaScript in the browser, server, mobile, and desktop environments. One of the key differentiators about JSConf is that its put on by a (crazy) group of JavaScript developers just like you, so we ensure that everything that matters is taken care. We believe quality matters over quantity and that you deserve a better conference every year running.</p>
        <p>The theme for JSConf US 2011 is "The JSConf Trail", sort of a play on the 8-bit game we all grew up with about the journey westward during the 1860s. Everything you have seen, heard, or come to know of about JSConf is about to change once again. Prepare your wagon and oxen to ford the river for an amazing time as the JavaScript community comes together once again in Portland, Oregon.</p>
        <p>We are trying to make something different and we are trying to do it with JavaScript.</p>
